Both needed advice and assistance with their health needs. I learnt a lot from both patients and other service providers who shared their perspectives on the issues homeless people face. 

Unfortunately I could not access Best Practice due to a combination of connectivity issues and my lack of knowledge. This was despite the efforts of Tess to try to help me over the phone and giving me a prior rundown - some students are like that Tess! I am organizing with Tess to come into the office and make sure I am on track for next clinic. At least I now know what I don't know.
